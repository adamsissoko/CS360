<h1>Mobile Architecture and Programming: A Showcase by Adam Sissoko</h1>

<h2>Overview of the Project</h2>
<p>
Welcome to this repository where we explore the expansive world of mobile architecture and programming, culminating in an event tracking application on the Android platform. This sophisticated application is designed to manage a user’s tasks and commitments through a robust architecture. It embraces various Android APIs, frameworks, and subsystems to provide a seamless and user-friendly interaction, going beyond the rudimentary functionalities usually found in similar applications.
</p>

<h3>Technological Foundations</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Android Studio:</strong> As the cornerstone for the app development, Android Studio offered a comprehensive set of tools for building and debugging Android applications, contributing to rapid iteration cycles.</li>
  <li><strong>SQLite Database:</strong> A cornerstone for data management, SQLite is utilized for the persistent storage of crucial user details and event information, ensuring data integrity and security.</li>
  <li><strong>RecyclerView:</strong> This Android component plays a critical role in the efficient and dynamic display of large sets of data, enhancing the app's scalability and responsiveness.</li>
  <li><strong>Alarm Manager:</strong> This Android service is vital for scheduling tasks and ensuring that the application sends out notifications at the appropriate times, regardless of its running state.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Comprehensive Feature Set</h3>
<p>
The application’s core functionalities are designed to offer an all-encompassing user experience. The features are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Advanced Authentication:</strong> 
    <p>Users are first greeted with a robust login screen that goes beyond mere username-password validation. The system utilizes SQLite databases to securely store hashed passwords and employs advanced security mechanisms to thwart unauthorized access.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Intuitive Event Management:</strong>
    <p>After authentication, the user is presented with an event management dashboard that offers advanced features. New events can be created, edited, or deleted, and they are presented in an elegant RecyclerView interface. Event details are comprehensive, including not just names but also descriptions, attachments, and scheduled times.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Reliable Notifications:</strong>
    <p>Utilizing the Alarm Manager API, users can set intricate reminders for events. This feature works flawlessly in the background, ensuring users never miss important commitments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Consistent Data Persistence:</strong>
    <p>SQLite databases have been meticulously implemented to ensure reliable and persistent data storage. This allows for a seamless user experience where all settings, tasks, and events remain intact over multiple user sessions.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
